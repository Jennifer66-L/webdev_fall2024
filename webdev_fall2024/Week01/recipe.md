> Avocado Toast Bonus Tips
- **Add garlic:** Lightly rub a peeled raw garlic clove over the top of your toast before adding the avocado, or mix a tiny pinch of garlic powder into the avocado.
- **Add fresh leafy herbs or your favorite herbed sauce:**: Chopped fresh basil, cilantro, dill or parsley are all good with avocado. So is a drizzle of pesto, zhoug sauce (spicy cilantro sauce), or chimichurri.
- **Put an egg on it**
